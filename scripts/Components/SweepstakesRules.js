        <p>
          7. <span className="font-normal">BINDING ARBITRATION:</span> Any controversy or claim
          arising out of or relating to this Sweepstakes shall be settled by binding arbitration in
          a location determined by the arbitrator as set forth herein (provided that such location
          is reasonably convenient for claimant), or at such other location as may be mutually
          agreed upon by the parties, in accordance with the procedural rules for commercial
          disputes set forth in the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS (“JAMS
          Rules and Procedures”) then prevailing, and judgment upon the award rendered by the
          arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator
          shall be selected pursuant to the JAMS Rules and Procedures. The arbitrator shall apply
          California law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of
          limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law. In the event that the
          claimant is able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as
          compared to the costs of litigation, Sponsor will pay as much of the claimant’s filing and
          hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to
          prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. If any part of this arbitration
          provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal (other than that claims will
          not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis), or otherwise conflicts with the
          JAMS Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in
          effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid,
          unenforceable, illegal, or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however,
          the portion that is deemed invalid, unenforceable, or illegal is that claims will not be
          arbitrated on a class or representative basis, then the entirety of this arbitration
          provision shall be null and void, and neither claimant nor Sponsor shall be entitled to
          arbitrate their dispute. Upon filing a demand for arbitration, all parties to such
          arbitration shall have the right of discovery, which discovery shall be completed within
          sixty (60) days after the demand for arbitration is made, unless further extended by
          mutual agreement of the parties. THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PURSUANT TO THIS PARAGRAPH
          SHALL BE IN THE ENTRANT’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN
          ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR
          JOIN THE CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS OR PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED. DO NOT ENTER
          THIS SWEEPSTAKES IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY ARBITRATED IN
          ACCORDANCE WITH THESE OFFICIAL RULES.
        </p>
        <p>
          BY PARTICIPATING IN THE SWEEPSTAKES, EACH ENTRANT AGREES THAT TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
          APPLICABLE LAW: (1) ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND CAUSES OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR
          CONNECTED WITH THE SWEEPSTAKES, OR ANY PRIZE AWARDED, WILL BE RESOLVED INDIVIDUALLY
          THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION AS SET FORTH ABOVE, WITHOUT RESORT TO ANY FORM OF CLASS
          ACTION; (2) ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, JUDGMENTS, AND AWARDS WILL BE LIMITED TO ACTUAL
          THIRD-PARTY, OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS INCURRED (IF ANY), BUT IN NO EVENT WILL ATTORNEYS’ FEES
          BE AWARDED OR RECOVERABLE; (3) UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ANY ENTRANT BE PERMITTED TO
          OBTAIN ANY AWARD FOR, AND ENTRANT HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND EXPRESSLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO
          SEEK, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS AND/OR ANY
          OTHER DAMAGES, OTHER THAN ACTUAL OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES, AND/OR ANY RIGHTS TO HAVE DAMAGES
          MULTIPLIED OR OTHERWISE INCREASED; AND (4) ENTRANT’S REMEDIES ARE LIMITED TO A CLAIM FOR
          MONEY DAMAGES (IF ANY) AND ENTRANT IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO SEEK INJUNCTIVE OR
          EQUITABLE RELIEF. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSION OF
          LIABILITY, SO THE ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO EVERY ENTRANT.

          10. Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify any entrant’s Entry in the Sweepstakes or
          entitlement to a prize, if, in the sole discretion of the Sponsor, it determines or
          suspects that the entrant has attempted to undermine the legitimate operation of the
          Sweepstakes by cheating, hacking, deception, or other fraudulent, deceptive, or unfair
          playing practices (including any Entries generated by script, macro, robotic, programmed,

          officers, directors, employees, and agents, from any and all liability, loss, rights,
